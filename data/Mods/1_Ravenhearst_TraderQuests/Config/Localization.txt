There is something that we need first and if you can do it then I will provide you a very valuable survival tool.\n\nI need you to retrieve a bag of medicine from one of our overrun outposts. We need this for something we are working on and if it is successful it could turn the tide of this wasteland. Bring back this bag and I will hook you up with something I know you need.","君が町に潜んでいるのを見て、手を貸してくれると思った。まず必要なものがある。それを持ってきてくれるなら、貴重なサバイバルツールを提供しよう。取り組んでいることに必要だし、成功したら、この荒れ地の流れを変えるかもしれない。この袋を持って帰ってきたら、必要なものを提供するよ"

Foxcheckman and his team to check on a tip we received from one our moles . The Lt and his team have not responded in 3 days. They may still be there if you know what I mean.\nOne of our rival gangs were taken out by some bad Makasin antibiotics and apparently those assholes had a huge supply of canned goods in a sack. We need all the food we can get. If you can find them for me I will make sure your time was worth it. What do you say?",
